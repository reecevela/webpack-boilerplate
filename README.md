# webpack-boilerplate
Same setup as my portfolio, only minor changes needed to get up and running from here

Just:

- git clone https://github.com/reecevela/webpack-boilerplate.git
- cd webpack-boilerplate
- edit config files and simply build your website/app
- npm i
- npm run deploy

And you're hosted on github!
